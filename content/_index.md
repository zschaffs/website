# a personal website, portfolio, and resume

My name is Zach Schaffer and I am a senior undergraduate student at Cornell University studying Operations Research & Engineering. I am also a first semester graduate student in the Masters of Engineering program.

I have developed a keen interest in data science throughout my studies and past experiences and am looking for an internship in this field. My skillset includes tools such as Python, R, SQL, Excel, and Tableau. Problem-solving is a passion of mine and I enjoy a challenge.

Aside from my technical abilities, I love public speaking and communicating with others. I also spend time enjoying hobbies such as fishing, skiing, and playing with my two doggies at home.
