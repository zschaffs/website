# Here are some cool projects I have worked on

## Demand Forecasting for E&J Gallo Winery
Most recently, I have been part of a graduate project team completing a time series forecasting project for E&J Gallo Winery. We have been given two years of historical monthly shipment values and have been tasked with developing new forecasting methods for the winery. Before modeling, we implemented clustering techniques such as K-means. We then used both time series and machine learning models to forecast future monthly demand. These models include: XGBoost, CatBoost, SVM, Prophet, ARIMA, and VAR. 

## Error Analysis for Hunova (MeaningBot)

Last summer I had the privilege of working for MeaningBot, now Hunova. As an intern I completed a summer project doing error analysis on the companies model outputs. For some background, this company has machine learning models which implement both psychology principles and NLP to take in a persons words and return a full personality assessment on them. So, my goal was to analyze the errors of their models compared to the data which they originally trained their models with to find any alarming behavior. Using python, I was able to complete statistical analysis as well as develop visualizations to dislay the behavior of their models and the discreptancies between the new personality trait scores and the old scores.
